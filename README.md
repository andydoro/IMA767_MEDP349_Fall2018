## Course Description

Physical computing is a set of tools and practices that enable artists, designers, and hobbyists to create electro-mechanical works that can sense aspects of the physical world and effect changes to it in ways beyond those offered by the standard desktop, laptop, or mobile computer. Physical computing practitioners use electronic components and physical materials to build devices that interact in some way with the physical world. These practices involve electronic sensors to detect physical input, microcontrollers to reformat and process that input, and actuators to effect changes in the physical world in response to that input

This course introduces students to microcontroller programming, electronics, and physical interaction design. The bulk of the course will focus on using the Arduino microcontroller to create experiences that extend beyond the computer screen. We will also examine the use of electronics and interactivity in art and design. Weekly hands-on labs, assignments, and readings will help students gain technical proficiency with these tools and develop a critical and creative eye for interactive technology.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course the student should be able to build and program basic microcontroller projects on the Arduino platform as well as have an understanding of physical interaction design. 

## Required Materials
* [Exploring Arduino by Jeremy Blum](https://www.exploringarduino.com/) (available at the Hunter Bookstore!)
* [Elegoo Starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-Project-Starter-Tutorial-Arduino/dp/B01D8KOZF4/) (best value!)  
* [MetroX kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3588) (another option)
* [ARDX kit from Tinkersphere](http://tinkersphere.com/boards/1443-ardx-arduino-kit-nyc.html) (can buy in person) 

### Suggested Tools
* multimeter
* breadboards
* 22-AWG solid core hook-up wire, various colors
* wire strippers
* diagonal cutters
* 9V DC 1A power supply
* soldering iron
* solder (lead free recommended)

It is likely that you will need additional materials depending on the nature of your projects. However, taking advantage of found and recycled materials is encouraged.


### Software
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)   
[GitHub](https://github.com/) -
used for posting code and homework assignments   
[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) - 
used for documenting electronics projects  


### Required Reading
[Exploring Arduino by Jeremy Blum](https://www.exploringarduino.com/)   
[Experimenters Guide for Metro](https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro) ([PDF version](http://ardx.org/src/guide/2/ARDX-EG-ADAF-PRINT.pdf))   
[Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

## Optional Reading
[Getting Started in Electronics by Forrest M. Mims III](https://www.adafruit.com/product/517)

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions. Unexcused absence, tardiness, or leaving early negatively impacts your attendance record and will damage your grade. If you anticipate being late or absent, let me know as early as possible. Medical emergencies must be documented to be excused. If you cannot attend class on the day of a quiz, you must speak with me ahead of time in order to arrange for you to take it another time. This will only be done in cases where there is a well-documented reason for missing the quiz. 

Participation means:    
* Being attentive and respectful when others are speaking or presenting.
  * During presentations, computers and cellphones may not be used and all laptops must be closed.  
  * Contributing to in-class discussion, asking relevant questions and providing constructive feedback to your peers.
* There are no dumb questions.  
* Sharing your work each week and following along with in-class labs.  
	* Failing to bring assignments and required materials to class will prevent you from participating.  
* Contributing to the online discussion in the [issues section](https://github.com/andydoro/IMA767_MEDP349_Fall2018/issues).

## Assignments

This is a production heavy class. If you do not have your own computer, you will be able to access the labs outside of class. Rooms HN470 & HN478 also have computers with the relevant software installed.  

Some equipment such as multimeters and soldering irons are available to borrow from the equipment room at HN435 although you may consider investing in purchasing your own tools.  

You must post assignments to the [class homework page](https://github.com/andydoro/IMA767_MEDP349_Fall2018/wiki/Homework) on the **following Tuesday, 11pm** before class. Bring your work to class each week and be prepared to talk about it. For each week an assignment is late, 10 points will be deducted from its grade.

Documentation of your work is required for all physical assignments. Refer to the [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/andydoro/IMA767_MEDP349_Fall2018/wiki/Documentation-Guidelines).

## Grading

* Assignments: 35%
* Attendance and Participation: 35%
* Final Project: 30%

### Final Project

The final project will demonstrate a large amount of time spent outside of class, though we will also spend a significant portion of the last weeks of class dedicated to the completion of this project. As such, it is expected to be more technically and critically engaging. 

* **Must be functional - your project must work!**
* Make an interactive system that can keep a user engaged with your system 
* Should be novel
* Should be soldered- not using a breadboard
* Must be [well documented](https://github.com/andydoro/IMA767_MEDP349_Fall2018/wiki/Documentation-Guidelines), including circuit diagrams and well-commented code
* Explain your design processes

## Electronic Device Policy 

Cellphones and internet usage during class should only relate to relevant classroom topics. During presentations, computers and cellphones may not be used and all laptops must be closed.

## Food & Drink Policy

Water, beverages, and small snacks are fine. There will be a 15 minute break in the middle of class. 

## Academic Integrity

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.
